 <h2 class="my-4">Patio Planning and Preparation</h2>
 <h3 class="my-4">Site Selection and Measurement</h3>
 <div>
 <p class="my-4 lead">Choosing the right location for your herringbone patio is crucial for both functionality and 
  aesthetics. Start by selecting a flat, well-drained area that complements your outdoor space. 
  Consider factors such as proximity to the house, sun exposure, and intended use. We designed our 
  patio to serve multiple purposes. First, we wanted a space where we could relax, entertain guests, 
  and enjoy a fire pit. Second, we needed an area inside the fence where we could park our car 
  securely, protecting it from prowlers.
</p>
 </div>

 <div>
  <p class="my-4 lead">
    Once you've chosen the perfect spot, measure the area accurately. Mark the boundaries with 
    stakes and string or spray paint, ensuring your measurements are precise. This step is essential for 
    calculating the amount of materials needed and for planning the layout of your herringbone 
    pattern. Proper site selection and measurement will set the foundation for a successful and 
    visually appealing patio.

 <h3 class="my-4">Design considerations and layout planning</h3>
 <div>
 <p class="my-4 lead">
  When designing your herringbone patio, consider both aesthetics and functionality. Think about 
  how the patio will complement your home's exterior and landscaping. Choose a pattern that enhances 
  your outdoor space, with herringbone offering a classic and visually appealing option.
 </p>
 </div>

 <div>
  <p class="my-4 lead">
    Plan the layout to accommodate your intended uses, whether it's for relaxing, entertaining, 
    or additional parking. Ensure there's enough space for furniture and other features like a 
    fire pit. Sketch the design on paper, marking dimensions and key elements. Proper planning 
    will help you visualize the final result and guide you through the construction process, 
    ensuring a seamless and attractive patio.

  There are many other patio paver design ideas to consider. Some popular options include a 
  classic brick patio, flagstone patio, concrete paver patio, stamped concrete patio, gravel patio, 
  and wood deck patio. Each offers a unique look and feel to enhance your outdoor space.
</em>
 </p>
</div>

<h3 class="my-4">Budgeting Tips</h3>
<div>
  <p class="my-4 lead">
    Accurate measurement is the most important part of planning your budget. When calculating 
    supplies, remember that having <strong>extra sand</strong> is crucial. Sand plays a vital role in leveling the 
    base and keeping the pavers securely in place, ensuring a durable and stable patio.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p class="my-4 lead">
    Pavers can be an economical material for building a patio. They come in various materials, 
    including concrete, brick, and stone. For our project, we chose the most inexpensive pavers 
    from Home Depot, which gave our patio a rustic, weathered look. With many types of pavers 
    available, some much more expensive than others, it's crucial to explore your options. Look, 
    touch, and envision the pavers you want to use while calculating your budget, as this choice 
    can significantly affect the overall cost.
 </p>

<p class="my-4 lead">
    We used <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/16-in-x-8-in-x-1-75-in-Pewter-Concrete-Step-Stone-74000/202026920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot Pewter Concrete Step Stones.</a>
    These Pavers in 2024 cost $1.74 per brick. They were the cheapest option 
    available for the size of brick we wanted. Pavers can range from $1 a brick to $30 a brick. 
  </p>
</div>


<h2 class="my-4">Step-By-Step How to Build a Patio With Pavers:</h2>
<h3 class="my-4">Step 1: Preperation</h3>
  <ol class="my-4 lead">
    <li>Measure and mark the patio area accurately to ensure a well-planned project.</li>
    <li>Remove any existing sod and vegetation to create a clear workspace.</li>
    <li>Excavate the soil to the desired depth, disposing of any excess material. If you want 
      the patio to be level with the surrounding area, you may need to dig deeper than expected. 
      For a solid and secure base, you will need 4 to 6 inches of gravel under your pavers. If the 
      pavers are 4 inches thick, this means you will need to dig 9 inches deep. This depth ensures 
      the pavers will sit flush with the surrounding landscape while providing a stable foundation.
    </li>
   <li>Install paver edging around the edge of the prepared site. Paver edging helps keep pavers, 
      gravel, and sand in place, ensuring a neat and durable finish. To install, position the 
      edging along the perimeter of your patio area and secure it by hammering in 8-inch stakes 
      through the provided holes. This method ensures the edging is incredibly sturdy, maintaining 
      the integrity of your patio structure.

      <p>We initially did not think we needed paver edging. And there are probably
        times when it is not always necessary. As we were laying our pavers, we realized
        how unstable the sides of our patio would be without it. Having seen the stabilization 
        it provided for the first patio, I will plan to install paver edging on any 
        future projects from the start.
    </li>

    <div class="card-body"><p class="card-text">Paver Edging</p>
   </div>
  </div>
  
 

  <h3 class="my-4">Step 2: Laying the Foundation</h3>
  <ol class="my-4 lead">
    <li>Add a layer of gravel base. This base should be 4 to 6 inces in depth for adequate
      structural support.
    </li>
    <li>Use a rake to ensure the gravel is distributed uniformly. Next, check for levelness using 
      a long, straight board and a spirit level, adjusting the gravel as needed to achieve a flat 
      surface. </li>
    <li>Once the gravel is level, compact it using a hand tamper or a plate compactor. Make several 
      passes over the entire area to ensure thorough compaction. This process creates a solid, 
      stable base, essential for the long-term durability of your patio.
    </li>
  </ol>

    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Tampers, shown above, can be found at your local hardware store. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3 class="my-4">Step 3: Creating the Pattern</h3>
  <ol class="my-4 lead">
    <li>Find the center of your patio area and mark the central axis. This 
      will help guide the pattern.
    </li>
    <li>Start at the center of the patio and place the first two pavers in an L-shape, with one 
      paver's end meeting the middle of the other paver’s side.
    </li>

    <div class="card my-4" style="width: 18rem;">
      <img src="../images/Lpattern.png" class="card-img-top" alt="the begining of herringbone pattern with bricks in L shape">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">Place the first two pavers in an L shape </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <li>Lay the next pavers so that each new paver intersects with the side of the previous paver 
      at a 90-degree angle, creating a zigzag or “V” pattern. Make sure each paver is snug against 
      the previous ones to maintain the integrity of the pattern.
    </li>

    <li>As you lay more pavers, periodically check that they are aligned correctly with the chalk 
      line and each other. Adjust as necessary to keep the pattern straight.
    </li>

    <li>Periodically fill the small gaps between pavers with sand. This will help lock the pavers
      in place. If we did not do this after 5-6 pavers it was easy to knock one out
      of place and have to adjust many of the pavers within that line. 
    </li>

    <div class="card my-4" style="width: 18rem;">

      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">Sweep sand inbetween pavers periodically and once all pavers have been laid. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <li>Once the main pattern is laid, you will need to cut pavers to fit the edges and corners. 
      Use a wet saw or a paver cutter for clean cuts. <a href="../How to cut pavers/howToCutPavers.html">Discover the best methods for cutting patio pavers right here!</a>
    </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="my-4">Step 4: Finishing Touches</h3>
    <ol class="my-4 lead">
    <li>
      Tap each paver gently with a rubber mallet to ensure they are set firmly into the sand base.
    </li>
    <li>Spread sand over the patio surface and sweep it into the joints between pavers. 
    </li>
    <li>Use a plate compactor to vibrate the pavers, ensuring they are firmly set and the joints 
      are filled with sand.
    </li>
    <li>Lightly mist the patio with water to help the sand move down into any holes. You may 
      have to add more sand and repete this step more than once.</li>
      <li>Step back and enjoy your new herringbone paver patio!</li>
  </ol>
</p>


<h2 class="my-4">Lessons Learned:</h2>
<h3 class="my-4">Challenges Faced</h3>
<div>
  <p class="my-4 lead">One of the biggest challenges we encountered was handling the sheer volume and weight of 
    materials needed for the patio. For our project, we had to move 200 bricks individually 
    from the shelf onto a cart, haul them into the back of our truck, and then unload them at home. 
    This was a time-consuming and physically demanding task.</p>
  <p class="my-4 lead">
    To save time and energy, consider checking with your supplier to see if they offer delivery 
    services. This can significantly ease the burden of transporting heavy materials. Additionally, 
    purchasing a pallet of bricks and having the store load it into your truck bed with a forklift 
    is another efficient option we could have utilized. These approaches can help streamline the 
    process and reduce the physical strain of moving heavy bricks and sand.
  </p>
    
  <h3 class="my-4">Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
    <p class="my-4 lead">Pavers are not always perfectly shaped, so when aligning them, it's 
      important not to push them tightly against each other repeatedly without checking their 
      alignment with the center line. Doing so can result in misaligned pavers that might 
      require redoing a portion of your patio, as I experienced. Accepting that gap sizes may 
      vary slightly allowed me to achieve much straighter lines. Regularly checking the 
      alignment and adjusting as needed helps maintain the integrity of the herringbone pattern.
